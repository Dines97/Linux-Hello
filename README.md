# WIP: Linux Hello

Linux Hello provides facial recognition based authentication for Linux. Use your built-in IR emitters and camera to prove who you are.

Using the central authentication system (PAM), this works everywhere you would otherwise need your password: Login, lock screen, sudo, su, etc.

Also, it's just Rust rewrite of old C++ project of mine, which is a bit meaningless considering
that I need to use two different C++ libraries in this project so yeah, it's just for fun
